Prophecy is
The fear in knowing things beforehand
Above the sky and matters
We can't help but stay here

A bird flies over the borderline

Glancing over a thousand earths
Gravity sets me free
Tempts me in
And keeps me at a loss

With electrons arcing away
The world gets entangled like a grapevine
Twisting one of the molecule's arms
So it's fit to the shape of my chest

Throwing myself off from the wharf
Sliding over the borderline between the real
and the imaginary
The bird flies

Flies through the borderline between the real
and the imaginary

I dared to pick up the phone receiver
Which nobody had ever tried to pick up
Memories have then grown thinner
The air's scenting of rains and a mystery

Prophecy is the fear in knowing things beforehand
Above the sky and matters
We can't help but stay here
